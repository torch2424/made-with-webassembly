## Motivation

After several Twitter threads ([1](https://twitter.com/torch2424/status/1194557590765596673), [2](https://twitter.com/JamesLMilner/status/1151824280914731008), ...) on highlighting use cases, projects, and companies in production using WebAssembly. Myself and a few other Wasm community members thought it'd be a great idea to have a dedicated place to find projects using WebAssembly, and highlight what WebAssembly can be used for! We were hoping it could be easy to comb through, and provide additional context on why/how individual project are using Wasm. üëçüèæ

## Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute! PRs are definitely welcome and appreciated! Below is a guide for contributing different parts of the project, and getting started with your first PR:

### General Contribution Areas

These are general areas of the project you may want to contribute to considering the architecture of the project:

#### Showcase Projects

The showcase projects are located under the `showcase/` directory in the project. Each showcase project is a markdown file, that adds metadata (E.g [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42952149/how-to-add-metadata-in-github-flavoured-markdown), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44215896/markdown-metadata-format)) to help describe the project. All showcase projects are added to the `showcase.json`, and output as an HTML file, by the `showcase-build.js` build script.

Contributing new projects is definitely welcome and super appreciated!

To add a new project to the showcase, create a markdown file with the following metadata (See other example if you get confused, or open an issue):

- `name` - The name of the project

- `description` - A Short description of the project. Will be used for fuzzy searching.

- `keywoards` - Space seperated list of words. This will be used for fuzzy searching.

- `logo_url` (OPTIONAL) - A Url to the logo for the project

- `website` (OPTIONAL) - A URL to the website for the project

- `source_url` (OPTIONAL) - A URL to the Source code for the project

Once you have your markdown file, you can test it in the project using `npm run dev`. And then, feel free to open a PR when the rendered showcase project markdown looks correct.

If you are a project owner and want the project edited or removed, please feel free to open a PR as well, or open an issue. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

#### App Shell

The App Shell is a [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) built with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) and [Preact CLI](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli). The applications shell can be found under the `src/` directory.

For larger ideas or new sections of the site, it is recommended to open an issue first for discussion.

### Getting Started with Your First PR

#### One-time Setup

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) if you don't already have one.
2. [Install and set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).
3. Install the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm). An easy way to do so is with `nvm`. (Mac and Linux: [here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), Windows: [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows))

```shell
nvm install --lts
```

4. Create your own fork of the [made-with-webassembly repository](https://github.com/torch2424/made-with-webassembly) by clicking "Fork" in the Web UI. During local development, this will be referred to by `git` as `origin`.

5. Download your fork to a local repository.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<your username>/made-with-webassembly.git
```

6. Add an alias called `upstream` to refer to the main `torch2424/made-with-webassembly` repository. Go to the root directory of the
   newly created local repository directory and run:

```shell
git remote add upstream git@github.com:torch2424/wasm-by-example.git
```

7. Fetch data from the `upstream` remote:

```shell
git fetch upstream master
```

8. Set up your local `master` branch to track `upstream/master` instead of `origin/master` (which will rapidly become
   outdated).

```shell
git branch -u upstream/master master
```

#### Branch (do this each time you want a new branch)

Create and go to the branch:

```shell
git checkout -b <branch name> master
```

#### Building & Running the project

1. Make sure you have the latest packages (after you pull): `npm install`
1. To build the project, run: `npm run build`
1. To serve, and build on changes for the project, run: `npm run dev`
