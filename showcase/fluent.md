Fluent is a general-purpose rollup on Ethereum that lets you build scalable blockchain applications in your preferred programming languages like Rust, TypeScript, Solidity, and more.

Think of Fluent as a [translator](https://mirror.xyz/fluentlabs.eth/EyB2e-wqezw2uAaFOsgoJvqaADhujof6d2ut62CKP8Q) between developers and Ethereum’s Infinite Garden. Developers should be able to step into the garden with little more than their core application knowledge - be it their app’s throughput needs or the programming language they know best.

Fluent’s job is to seamlessly translate their knowledge into the blockchain context. To make Ethereum speak their language.
