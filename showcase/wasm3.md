Wasm3 allows running WebAssembly everywhere, and supports a wide range of architectures. In fact, it can run on network equipment, routers, modems, microcontrollers, IoT devices. It can also be embedded into any desktop or smartphone application and serve as a scripting engine. Wasm3 also enables WebAssembly self-hosting (literally running WebAssembly on top of WebAssembly).
