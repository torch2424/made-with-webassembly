Wasm Sudoku Solver is an Augemented Reality application, that uses OpenCV, Tensorflow, and a sudoku solver written in Rust.

From the Blog Post, the author Colin Eberhardt states:

> This project makes use of the WebAssembly build of OpenCV (a C++ computer vision library), Tensorflow (a machine learning library) and a solver written in Rust. It neatly demonstrates how WebAssembly allows you to write performance-critical web-based applications in a wide range of languages.

I definitely reccomend reading the full blog post, as it goes deep into detail on how the project works. The post is a geat read, with tons of insight on WebAssembly!
