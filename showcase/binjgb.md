Gameboy emulator implemented in C. Runs in the browser using WebAssembly.

Binjgb uses Wasm for it's emulation core, which runs all of the compuationally heavy logic of emulating the GameBoy. This is written in C, and compiled to WebAssembly using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

Gameboy emulation on the web, has historically been for desktop web and high-end mobile devices that could handle heavy computation that is required for emulation. But, with WebAssembly, this type of emulation can be run faster, and thus run on lower-end devices. Which I (Aaron Turner), have personally tested Binjgb to do this, and is awesome for people who could not afford a web-enabled devices with the performance characteristics that were required the old JavaScript GameBoy emulators.

Though it is not a direct WebAssembly vs. JavaScript performance compariosn. Binjgb outperforms the most popular JavaScript Gameboy emualtor, [GameBoy Online](https://github.com/taisel/GameBoy-Online). This can be tested on the "Enable of emulators" on [WasmBoy Benchmark](https://wasmboy.app/benchmark/).
