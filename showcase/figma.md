Figma is a collaborative interface design tool, powered by WebAssembly.

Figma uses WebAssembly, as the application was originally written in C++, and exported to Asm.js using Emscripten. However, after WebAssembly launched, they switched to WebAssembly by adding the appropriate Emscripten flags, and saw 3x performance increase!
