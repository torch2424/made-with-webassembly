An acoustic absorption calculator to help in the design of rooms in which acoustic accuracy is important, such as a home cinema or a recording studio.

The Porous Absorber Calculator uses WebAssembly (compiled from Rust), to create an absoprtion curve of a particular thickness of porous absorber layer (such as glass fibre or Rockwool) mounted either directly against a wall, or with an air gap between the wall and the porous layer.

## Additional Resources

- The equations used to calculate these absorption curves are taken from the first edition of the book [_"Acoustic Absorbers and Diffusers"_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Acoustic-Absorbers-Diffusers-Third-Trevor/dp/1498740995) by Trevor Cox and Peter D'Antonio (now in its third edition)
