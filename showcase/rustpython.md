RustPython is a Python-3 (CPython >= 3.5.0) Interpreter written in Rust. Runs in the browser using WebAssembly. Runs standalone on WebAssembly runtimes using [WASI](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/).

RustPython uses WebAssembly as it offers a WebAssembly build by using the great tooling for WebAssembly in the rust ecosystem. This is awesome, as it allows for running Python in JavaScript Environments! This really shows off how WebAssembly has the ability to bring more languages to the web! Also, there are WASI builds of the interpreter, meaning the interpreter can be run as a CLI tool in Server Side WebAssembly runtimes like [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/), [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/), or even in the browser with [Wasmer-JS](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-js)! Another thing, rustpython is distributed through [WAPM](https://wapm.io/package/rustpython), Which highlights the portability of WebAssembly, in its ability to be easily bundled and distributed.
