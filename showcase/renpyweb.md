RenPy is a cross-platform game engine, with a web export (RenPyWeb) powered by WebAssembly.

This project uses WebAssembly as it exports a web player for games made in Renpy, using Emscripten outputting WebAssembly.This means that games that traditionally could not export to the web due to slowdowns with JavaScript, may now be able to get a consistent good performance on the web for both 2d and 3d games.
