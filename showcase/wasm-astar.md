This is a great use case for WebAssembly, as it shows off the portability of Wasm! As in, Wasm allows other languages other than JavaScript to run in a web browser. And on top of that, will offer predictable performance, meaning computationally intesive applications like games, and gaming related tasks, will be able to perform in a browser with predictable performance!

Also, I definitely reccomend reading through this project's [README](https://github.com/jakedeichert/wasm-astar). As it goes into detail on the developers Rust / Wasm experience
