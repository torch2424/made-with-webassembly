bam.bio, a playground for samtools, a genomics CLI ported from C to #WebAssembly so it can run directly in the browser!

As stated by the Author, Robert Aboukhalil:

> This is another example of why WebAssembly is a Big Dealâ„¢: samtools is 80K+ lines of code. Rewriting that in JavaScript would not have been fun ðŸ˜… Also, shout out to Emscripten folks who have built a really awesome tool for porting C/C++ code to WebAssembly.

Which I definitely agree with. This really shows off the portability of WebAssembly, in which WebAssembly allows compiling existing code to WebAssembly so it can run on multiple platforms, such as web browsers!
