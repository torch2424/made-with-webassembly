This is a great example of WebAssembly, as traditionally 3d modeling software requires fast, predictable performance. Which is something that is very hard, if possible, to achieve in JavaScript. WebAssembly being a bytecode can offer this predictable performance, to allow tradtionally desktop, or native apps to come to the web by having WebAssembly as a compiler target for their heavy processing and cpu intensive code!
