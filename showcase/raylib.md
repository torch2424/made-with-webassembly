A simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming

![ScreenShot](https://www.raylib.com/common/img/raylib_logo_card.png)

raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics library and by XNA framework and it's specially well suited for prototyping, tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems and education.
raylib library is multiplatform and extremely portable (binded to [+50 programming languages](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/BINDINGS.md) to date), it can easily generate Web applications contained in less than 400KB of WASM code.
raylib is the perfect option for web applications requiring high-performance and super-fast loading times. Multiple raylib-based applications running on web can be [tested here](https://raylibtech.itch.io/).
