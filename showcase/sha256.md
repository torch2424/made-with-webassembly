## SHA256 Message Digest

Based on the excellent overview of the SHA256 algorithm available at [SHA256Algorithm](https://sha256algorithm.com/), I decided to see how small a binary I could create by implementing this functionality directly in WebAssemb;y Text.

The results are pretty encouraging - 951 byte!

### Known Performance Issue - But Not With WebAssembly

The performance of the JavaScript coding used to create the host environment is known to be slow. When calculating the digest of a large file (E.G. a 100Mb MP4 movie file), the JavaScript coding is **_really_** slow...

When testing against a big MP4 file, the program takes just over 9 seconds to complete; however, JavaScript needs 7.5 of those seconds to load the file into WASM shared memory...

Once loaded however, the `.wasm` binary calculates the SH256 digest in a time that's very similar to the built-in macos program `sha256sum`.
