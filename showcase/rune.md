Rune makes it possible to develop, deploy, and manage apps and AI models on edge
devices like the browser, mobile, or embedded.

In the next few years, we are expecting a quadratic growth in sensors
(especially Arm/Nvidia based devices) and data (5G) resulting in the need for a
massive number of developers and applications. Here at Hammer of the Gods, we
are building the distributed infrastructure to pave the way for AI enabled edge
applications.

All of this is made possible by compiling Machine Learning pipelines to
WebAssembly.
