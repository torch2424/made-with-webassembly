Pure Go implementation of the WebRTC API

![ScreenShot](https://github.com/pion/webrtc/raw/master/.github/pion-gopher-webrtc.png)

Pion WebRTC is a pure Go implementation of WebRTC. It has zero non-Go dependencies and no 3rd party Go dependencies. Pion WebRTC can be used when compiled to WebAssembly, also known as WASM. In this case the library will act as a wrapper around the JavaScript WebRTC API. This allows you to use WebRTC from Go in both server and browser side code with little to no changes.
