Extism is a plug-in system for everyone. We've carefully designed it to be flexible, fitting into codebases of all shapes and sizes, but opinionated enough so that things Just Workâ„¢ the way they should. Extism's goal is to make all software programmable, and with support for over 15 programming languages, it's the easiest way to run WASM functions directly in your app.

Add a fast, flexible, and secure plug-in system to your project. Server, desktop, mobile, web, database -- you name it. Enable users to write and execute safe extensions to your software.
