## About

**WASM-4** is a low-level fantasy game console for building small games with WebAssembly. Game
cartridges (ROMs) are small, self-contained `.wasm` files that can be built with any programming
language that compiles to WebAssembly.

## Key Features

- **No Glue Code**: If you've ever tried to write even a simple "Hello World"
  with WebAssembly before, you'll know it usually involves writing a bunch of
  JS and HTML glue. WASM-4 removes all of that, games interface directly with
  the system through a small API.

- **Minimalist**: Fantasy consoles force developers to work with limited resources.
  This makes them simple to learn, and easier to focus on finishing your game.

- **Language Agnostic**: Use any programming language, as long as it can compile to WebAssembly. Out of
  the box we currently support: AssemblyScript, C/C++, Rust, Go.

- **Portable**: WASM-4 is designed to run on any device that can execute WebAssembly, even outside of
  the web! We're planning a lightweight implementation written in C that will run even on a potato.

## ðŸš€ 60 Second Quickstart

```shell
# Install the w4 command

# Create a project
w4 new --assemblyscript hello-world

# Setup toolchain
cd hello-world
npm install

# Build and run your game!
npm run build
w4 run build/cart.wasm
```
