Streamdal is an open-source _'Code-Native Data Pipeline'_ solution for running
data pipelines directly in your application code.

Streamdal equips you with a data observability graph and rule-based management
tool to handle PII and help take action on data. It's built on a collection of
several open-source components - an SDK, a server, and a console UI - designed
to integrate seamlessly into your code.

Streamdal uses Wasm to execute pipelines at near-native speeds - It's
ridiculously fast.

Currently, we have support for Go, Python, and Node. More languages,
libs/shims/wrappers/extensions, etc are coming in the future!
