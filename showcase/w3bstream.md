W3bstream is a public Layer-2 infrastructure for builing decentralized applications based on data from the physical world, using a WebAssembly VM as the data processing and proof generation engine.

W3bstream uses AssemblyScript as it's language of choice for writing the machine data logic. You can try it out at [W3bstream Studio](https://devnet.w3bstream.com/). They chose to use WebAssembly mostly fo the security and isolation it provides between different modules belonging to different projects.
